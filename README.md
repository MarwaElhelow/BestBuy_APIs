# BestBuy_APIs
This Project is implemented in JSON using Postman Automation , and URLs are gotten from Swagger on --> http://localhost:3030/docs/#!/.

The APIs that have been tested are :
List all Products / Add a new Service / Search for a specific service / Create new store / Edit Store Data / Search for a specific Product / Delete a Product.

Here is a screen shot attached for the first Run of this product as may some test cases will fail due to the effect of creation of the new service with a new ID.

Test cases are designed to Assert Response Data, and Status code , and Response time.
